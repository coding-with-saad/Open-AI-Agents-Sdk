# OpenAI Agents SDK

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. It's a **production-ready** upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, **Swarm**.

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts

The Agents SDK includes a small set of powerful primitives:

- **Agents**  
  LLMs equipped with instructions and tools.

- **Handoffs**  
  Allow agents to delegate tasks to other agents.

- **Guardrails**  
  Validate the inputs to agents to ensure reliability and safety.
